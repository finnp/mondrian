abstract = {We examined the interactive contribution of the color and size of the three areas occupied by the primary colors red, yellow, and blue in adaptations of abstract compositions by Mondrian to the perceived weight of the areas and the location of the balance centers of the compositions. Thirty-six art stimuli were created by experimentally changing the colors in the three areas of six original works so that the resulting five variations and the original constituted the six possible spatial arrangements of the three colors in the three locations. In experiment 1, design-trained and untrained participants determined the location of the balance center of each composition seen on a computer screen and rated the apparent weight or heaviness of each color area. In experiment 2, untrained participants determined the location of the balance centers of the compositions when projected to their actual size. It was found that, for both trained and untrained participants, the perceived weight of a color, especially red and yellow, varied as a function of the size of the area it occupied. Furthermore, participants in both experiments perceived shifts in the locations of the balance centers between the originals and their altered versions. Only the trained participants, however, perceived significant shifts in balance centers among the five variations of the compositions, demonstrating their superior sensitivity to the contribution of color to balance structure. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the existence of a color-area-weight relationship among color triads in abstract displays and the influence of this relationship on color balance in abstract compositions.

@article{Winner1987,
abstract = {Two principles of pictorial composition were tested: the left-right principle (pictures appear balanced with more weight on the left than on the right) and the up-down principle (pictures appear balanced with more weight on the bottom than on the top). In the first study, adults and children saw pictures and their reversals and showed no preference for the "correct" versions. In the second study, subjects were taught either the "correct" principles, the opposite principles, or no principles and then selected the most balanced picture of each pair. For the lateral reversals, all subjects again selected at chance; for the vertical reversals, subjects taught the "correct" principles chose accordingly, while those taught the opposite or no principles still chose at random. Thus, subjects can be induced to choose according to the up-down principle but not according to its violation. This study provides support for the up-down but not the left-right principle.},

@article{Markowsky1992,
abstract = {The golden ratio, also called by different authors the golden section [Cox], golden number [Fi4], golden mean [Lin], divine proportion [Hun], and division in extreme and mean ratios [Smi], has captured the popular imagination and is discussed in many books and articles. Generally, its mathematical properties are correctly stated, but much of what is presented about it in art, architecture, literature, and esthetics is false or seriously misleading. Unfortunately, these statements about the golden ratio have achieved the status of common knowledge and are widely repeated. Even current high school geometry textbooks such as [Ser] make many incorrect statements about the golden ratio. It would take a large book to document all the misinformation about the golden ratio, much of which is simply the repetition of the same errors by different authors. This paper discusses some of the most commonly repeated misconcep- tions.},

@article{Pizer1987,
abstract = {Adaptive histogram equalization (ahe) is a contrast enhancement method designed to be broadly applicable and having demonstrated effectiveness. However, slow speed and the overenhancement of noise it produces in relatively homogeneous regions are two problems. We report algorithms designed to overcome these and other concerns. These algorithms include interpolated ahe, to speed up the method on general purpose computers; a version of interpolated ahe designed to run in a few seconds on feedback processors; a version of full ahe designed to run in under one second on custom VLSI hardware; weighted ahe, designed to improve the quality of the result by emphasizing pixels' contribution to the histogram in relation to their nearness to the result pixel; and clipped ahe, designed to overcome the problem of overenhancement of noise contrast. We conclude that clipped ahe should become a method of choice in medical imaging and probably also in other areas of digital imaging, and that clipped ahe can be made adequately fast to be routinely applied in the normal display sequence.},
