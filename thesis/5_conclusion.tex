% Summary of the findings and conclusions


% What deserves further research?

The data we obtained did not show a preferred use of the golden or silver ratio
in the rectangles of Mondrian's paintings.




% Color distribution numbers close to Paretos Principle. Maybe 80% of the
% effect of the painting stem from the 20% of the colors. Psychological research?
% eye-tracking studies

Is there an explanation why red is more common in the top-left corner?

In "Art and Visual Perception" Rudolg Arnheim \cite{Arnheim1965} notes that "an
object in the upper part of the composition is heavier tha none in the lower;
and location at the right side makes more weight than location on the left."
Winner (1987) \cite{Winner1987} psychologically tested these principles by
showing abstract images and their horizontally or vertically flipped
counterparts. Their findings support the up-down-principles, but not the
left-right-principle.
It would be interesting to explore if the preference by Mondrian to use red
in the top-left corner could be explained by a combination of these principles
or whether it is merely coincidental or habitual.
