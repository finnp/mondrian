\section{Introduction}

Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) oeuvre consists of naturalistic painting as well
as abstract compositions. Up until 1910 his works depicted scenes like
churches, trees, windmills or landscapes. From 1911 his paintings
remain representational but start to be painted in a more abstract way.

Around 1914 his compositions begin to be purely abstract and in 1917 he founds
the artistic movement \textit{De Stijl} also known as \textit{Neoplasticism}.
One of the stated goals of this movement is to reform art by "abolishing natural
form" \cite{wiki:manifest} altogether.

At some point then Mondrian restricted his compositional elements to rectangles
and horizontal as well as vertical straight lines. Only primary colors (red, blue and
yellow) and non-colors (black, white and grey) were allowed to use.

In 1968 Hill \cite{Hill1968} analysed the network topology of Mondrian's paintings.
While he did not see value in metrical analysis of Mondrian paintings, he called
for a more detailed analysis of his paintings. He criticised earlier work for
the lack of statistics.

While it is said that many people have tried and failed analysing Mondrian's
paintings for certain ratios, there hasn't been many people actually testing
the hypotheses.

In a presentation from 2017 Tanaka and Miyanaga \cite{Tanaka2017} examine the use
of rectangle ratios, specifically the golden and silver ratio, in 10 late
Mondrian paintings. Their suggesting a preference of Mondrian for the silver
ratio.

However to the authors knowledge there is no publication discussing the question of
the use of certain ratios with a bigger data set.

\subsubsection{Computer-generated Mondrian}

% TODO: Write more about Fejs, read that paper again

Feijs (2004)\cite{Feijs2004} presents different techniques for generating images
resembling non-figurative Mondrian paintings from different times. He  concludes
that different kinds of algorithms for generating images can be used to
formalise the distinction between different types of Mondrian paintings.

% TODO: Better Skrodzki section

Skrodzki and Polthier (2018) \cite{Skrodzki2018} use computer models to generate
Mondrian-inspired three-dimensional pieces. They note however that while their
results are similar to Mondrian paintings, they do not all resemble Mondrian
paintings in a way that proportions are randomly chosen and not carefully.
