\subsection{Piet Mondrian}

The oeuvre of Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) consists of figurative paintings as well
as abstract compositions. Up until 1910 his works only depicted naturalistic
scenes like churches, trees, windmills or landscapes. From 1911 onwards his
paintings remain representational but are increasingly painted in a more
abstract way.

Around 1914 his compositions begin to be purely abstract and in 1917 he cofounds
the artistic movement and group \textit{De Stijl} also known as
\textit{Neoplasticism}. One of the primary objecteives of the group is to reform
art by "abolishing natural form" \cite{wiki:manifest} altogether.

At some point around 1920 Mondrian further restricted his compositional elements
to rectangles and straight black lines. The lines were only allowed to run
horizontally or vertically. Only primary colors (red, blue and yellow) and
non-colors (black, white and grey) were allowed to be used.

Another founding member of \textit{De Stijl}, Georges Vantongerloo, used methods
inspired from mathematics for his compsitions. One example of this is his
painting "Composition Derived from the Equation y = -ax2 + bx + 18".

Mondrian on the other hand is known to only use intuition when creating his
works, moving compositional elements for weeks, seeking a balanced composition,
until he was satisfied with the result.

Still many people have been interested in the question if Mondrian's
non-figurative paintings utilize certain compositional rules or techniques that
the painter might have used unconsciously. One approach that only became
feasible in the 1960s is to recreate art that resembles Mondrians composition
using computers.

In 1968 Hill \cite{Hill1968} analysed the network topology of Mondrian's paintings.
While he did not see value in metrical analysis of Mondrian paintings, he called
for a more detailed analysis of his paintings. He criticised earlier work for
the lack of statistics.

While it is said that many people have tried and failed analysing Mondrian's
paintings for certain ratios, there hasn't been many people actually testing
the hypotheses.

In a presentation from 2017 Tanaka and Miyanaga \cite{Tanaka2017} examine the use
of rectangle ratios, specifically the golden and silver ratio, in 10 late
Mondrian paintings. Their suggesting a preference of Mondrian for the silver
ratio.

However to the authors knowledge there is no publication discussing the question of
the use of certain ratios with a bigger data set.

\subsubsection{Computer-generated Mondrian}

% TODO: Write more about Fejs, read that paper again

Feijs (2004)\cite{Feijs2004} presents different techniques for generating images
resembling non-figurative Mondrian paintings from different times. He  concludes
that different kinds of algorithms for generating images can be used to
formalise the distinction between different types of Mondrian paintings.

% TODO: Better Skrodzki section

Skrodzki and Polthier (2018) \cite{Skrodzki2018} use computer models to generate
Mondrian-inspired three-dimensional pieces. They note however that while their
results are similar to Mondrian paintings, they do not all resemble Mondrian
paintings in a way that proportions are randomly chosen and not carefully.

"The lesson is that we must exploit digital technology to the full and set Mondrian's
designs into the relevant space of possibilities if we are ever to put judgments
of aesthetic balance on a firm footing – which at present they are clearly not."
"Such findings also suggest that we can put the formalist sector of aesthetic
response on a firm footing only by much more extensive and rigorous
experimentation with transforms of existing designs"
